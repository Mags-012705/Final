# Final
It's the Final (Countdown).

Final Prototype:

# Development Log

## May 21
Julia: Created Final Project document to jot down ideas. Outlined most of the ideas needed for prototype.

## May 22
Julia: Created prototype document and transferred relevant information from final project document onto it. Also created UML diagram.

## May 23
Julia: Worked on branching and merging and worked on line drawing for the project.

## May 24
Julia: Created Segment class and changed up variables as well as function names to operate as needed. Also created the SegmentList class to hold all visible segments. Should have basic functionality working so that it can be implemented as needed into the game.

## May 25
Julia: Drawing is working now and extra features such as weight of the line should work.

## May 26
Julia: Outlined functions for distance and began writing onSegment() to detect whether the avatar is on a segment.

## May 27
Julia: onSegment() boolean version has been renamed to isOnSegment() and onSegment() remains as is. Finished writing them for now.

## May 28
Julia: Testing distance functions and made changes to them to make sure they detect lines properly.

## May 29

## May 30
Julia: Fixed the constructor of line segment which calculated the segment's line equation.

## May 31
Julia: Added color selection and erase mode.

## June 1

## June 2
Julia: Fixed vertical line detection.

## June 3
Julia: Began working on using transformations in our code. Researched and determined how to make the avatar rotate. It should display for now.

## June 4
Julia: Avatar should display and rotate appropriately according to the slope of the line.

## June 5
Julia: The screen should zoom into the avatar and follow it as it moves. Toggling this is possible by pressing the Z key.

## June 6
Julia: Cleaned up code and added a getDistance() function for segment detection to make the code easier to read and change.

## June 7
Julia: Began working on fixing an issue on my collaborator's end, but aborted all changes after I was informed that she seemed to have fixed the problem.

## June 8
Julia: Began working on expanding the map by dragging the mouse across the screen while holding down a key.

## June 9
Julia: Expansion of map should now be possible.

## June 10
Julia: Made changes to segment detection so that they sled will detect a segment even the center of the sled is not directly on top of a line.

## June 11
Julia: Added buttons to the screen that will change modes.
